### Project #1: Analyzing Unicorn Companies

Which industries are booming? Where should your next investment be? With the rise of the ‘amateur investor’ and the availability of platforms enabling people to invest and sell stock in public companies, it’s never been a better time to understand the financial performance of companies across the globe!

Using a PostgreSQL database i’ll be able to analyze information about unicorn companies worth over $1 billion! I’ll find out which industries have the highest average valuation and then zoom in on these to determine how many new unicorns have been produced annually between 2019 and 2021!

### Project #2: Analyze International Debt Statistics

In this project, we are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. You are going to find the answers to questions like:

What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
The data used in this project is provided by [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home). It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.

### Project #3: Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue

In this notebook, I will use my SQL skills to analyze product data for an online sports retail company.

I will work with numeric, string, and timestamp data on pricing and revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic.

I will also use techniques such as aggregation, cleaning, labeling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation to produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue!

### Project #4: Trends in Maryland Crime Rates 

Is the violent crimes rate in Maryland increasing, decreasing, or staying the same? In this project, we will find out! First, I will wrangle the raw data supplied by the State of Maryland. Second, you will analyze the data using a hierarchical regression to examine both the statewide crime rate and crime rate for each Maryland county. Third, you will plot the changes in crime rates for each county.

We will use the [crime statistics](http://goccp.maryland.gov/crime-statistics/) from the State of Maryland from 1975 to 2016. The Maryland Statistical Analysis Center provides this and updates data.

### Project #5: Rise and Fall of Programming Languages

How can you tell what programming languages and technologies are used by the most people? How about what languages are growing and which are shrinking, so that you can tell which are most worth investing time in? One excellent source of data is Stack Overflow, a programming question and answer site with more than 16 million questions on programming topics. By measuring the number of questions about each technology, you can get an approximate sense of how many people are using it. In this project, you'll use open data from the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/) to examine the relative popularity of languages like R, Python, Java and Javascript have changed over time.
